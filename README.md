Project description: A multiplayer tag game for 4 players, with fun modes, including classic and superpower. 
Each round, "IT" is selected randomly and has the ability to "tag" other players on the game board. 
The last person to be tagged loses when time is up (for elimination and infection modes, this works a little differently). 
This is TAG 2.0, a better and more intense version of multiplayer tag!
