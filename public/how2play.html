    <h1>TAG 2.0: How To Play</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Click "Play" You should be redirected to a page that offers you to Play
        <li>Use the mouse to click on the play button</li>
        <li>Once redirected, utilize the arrow keys to move around</li>
        <li>How to move:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the "W" key to move up on the canvas</li>
                <li>Use the "A" key to move left on the canvas</li>
                <li>Use the "S" key to move down on the canvas</li>
                <li>Use the "D" key to move right on the canvas</li>

            </ul>
            <li>If you're the tagger, your goal is to tag the other players. Once you tag them, they are eliminated and they will be redirected to the YOU DIED page</li>
            <li>If you're not the tagger, your goal is to stay away from the tagger. If you are tagged, you will be redirected to the YOU DIED page</li>
            <li>Use WASD to maneuver across the canvas to either evade the tagger or get in contact with the players. If you're the tagger, use SPACEBAR to tag players to eliminate them</li>
